Page containing solutions for many of the past British Informatics Olympiad problems, with a focus on the Q3s

For some questions, there is an analysis at the end of each question, explaining the solution and method used to solve it.

I'm also happy to explain any solutions. If you'd like me to explain a solution please leave something in the Issues section.
